 The LINCS L1000 dataset is a huge high dimensional library of dataset that is used to know
 how human cells react to different drugs and it shows immense promise for understanding and
 treating diseases. It can be used as a very powerful resource for discovering drugs mechanism
 of action (MoA), but using it effectively isn’t very straightforward. When using this dataset,
 Scientists have to overcome huge computational hurdles, like considering about its huge size,
 inherent experimental noise, an incomplete information. To understand how the research
 community is tackling these above mentioned problems, a deep dive into the last decade of
 scientific literature was made in this study. We systematically reviewed 28 key studies published
 between 2014 and 2025 that use machine learning and deep learning to unlock the secrets
 hidden within the L1000 dataset, aiming to find new uses for existing drugs and identify novel
 therapeutic targets. This review uncovered a step by step story of technological evolution.
 There was a clear shift from traditional machine learning methods to powerful and morereliable
 deep learning methods that could handle the data complexity more effectively. As researchers
 built more sophisticated and complex models using tools like Graph Neural Networks, their
 predictive accuracy improved. Even though the model accurecy gets better with time and
 change of method, more crucial challenges remain such as, making these powerful “black box”
 models more transparent or understandlable. This has sparked an important new trend toward
 “explainable AI” (XAI), a push to not only get the right answer but to understand why it’s
 the right answer. So, what does this all mean? The work from this study shows that the
 field is at a crossroads, where not only simply predicting a drug’s effect is important but also
 understanding the mechanism behind the predicting is important as well. The next great
 leap forward will come from building models that are not only accurate but also trustworthy
 and transparent in the users eyes. By developing smarter, more interpretable frameworks
 and combining different types of data, we can finally narrow and bridge the gap from massive
 datasets to real-world impact, turning this crucial information into new medications and better
 treatments for improved patient care.
